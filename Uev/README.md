# User Experience Virtualization scheduled task

Deploys a scheduled task to run a script that downloads a set of custom User Experience Virtualization templates pushed to blob storage on an Azure storage account. Used with Windows 10 Enterprise PCs managed via Microsoft Intune (or other MDM).

See this repository for a continuous integration approach to testing UE-V templates and pushing them along with the deployment script to an Azure storage account: [https://github.com/aaronparker/uev](https://github.com/aaronparker/uev).
