# User Experience Virtualization

Deploy `Set-Uev.ps1` via Intune to target PCs to enable the UE-V service, download the templates from the storage account and register them locally.

The script will download a set of UE-V templates that are pushed to an Azure storage account. See the templates here: [https://github.com/aaronparker/azure-uev](https://github.com/aaronparker/azure-uev)
